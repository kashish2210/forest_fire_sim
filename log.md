✅ 1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
DEM File: uttarakhand_dem.tif — Elevation data.

LULC File: lulc_uttarakhand.tif — Land Use / Land Cover data.

Weather File: weather_2024.nc — NetCDF weather dataset.

VIIRS Fire Map: Dummy binary label created to simulate fire occurrence zones.

You:

Loaded these datasets using rasterio and xarray.

Normalized and stacked them into a .npz file for model input.

Saved the target fire label map using VIIRS-style logic.

✅ 2. Model Training
Built and trained a basic U-Net style segmentation model to predict binary fire zones.

Input: stacked features (.npz), Output: predicted fire probability map (.tif).

Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy.

Saved the model + output as prediction_day1.tif.

✅ 3. Prediction Pipeline
Wrote predict.py to:

Load model & data.

Predict fire probability across full image.

Save prediction as GeoTIFF (outputs/prediction_day1.tif).

✅ 4. Visualization Tools
Built visualize.py with:

🔥 Fire Probability Heatmap.

🟥 Fire Zones (thresholded).

🌄 Overlay of DEM and Fire Labels.

📈 Stat summary: Min, Max, Mean of prediction.

🌱 Preview of initial fire seeds for simulation.

✅ 5. Fire Spread Simulation
Simulated fire spread from high-probability seed zones.

Used elevation slope & connectivity for basic fire expansion logic.

Output: animated .gif showing temporal fire spread.

🔧 Bonus (In Progress)
GitHub Actions workflows for packaging & PyPI publishing.

Trusted publisher config in progress (for PyPI automation).

Would you like to now:

Add better model evaluation (metrics, confusion matrix)?

Improve fire simulation realism (wind/slope factors)?

Make it a CLI or Streamlit app?

Let’s keep going — you're building something powerful!
